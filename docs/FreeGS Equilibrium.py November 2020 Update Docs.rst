1. General New Features
=======================
* Several new general-use features have been added to equilibrium.py.

* None of the following require input arguments. E.g to print a result: print(eq.AveragePlasmaPressure()).

* To call one of these functions within equilibrium.py you'd simply use: *self*.plasmaArea() + *self*.AveragePlasmaPressure(), as an example where you are adding the plasma area to the average plasma pressure.

* A function plasmaArea(), which operates very similarly to the already existing plasmaVolume(), has been added.

* A function AveragePlasmaPressure() has been added.

* plasmaW(), which calculates the internal energy (the plasma W), has been added.

2. New Functions for ITER-Like Tokamaks
=======================================  
* In addition to the above changes, several other functions have been added, but for the time being **these are tailored to ITER-like tokamaks operating in H-mode**.

* However, *this can be changed by changing the front factor of AverageElDensity() and the scaling parameters of tauE_Coeffs*.

* These functions also do not require input arguments, and can be called like those in the previous section.

* The following functions calculate average densities: AverageElDensity(); AverageDT_IonDensities() (returns a matrix with the two densities); AverageImpurityDensity(); AverageTotDensity().

* ElDensityRatio() calculates the electron peak-to-average density ratio.

* Working from those functions, the following calculate the peak densities: PeakElDensity(); PeakDT_IonDensities() (returns a matrix with the two values); PeakImpurityDensity(); PeakTotDensity().

* AverageTemperature() calculates the average particle temperature, by using the ideal gas law considering all particles.

* The function PowerL() calculates the loss power of the plasma.

* The function tauE() calculates the confinement time.

* The function tauE_Coeffs is required for PowerL() and tauE() to run.

* By default, AverageElDensity() uses 300 npoints (i.e, 300 points on the plasma's outer edge) when it calls on the minorRadius function, but this can be changed as appropriate. As a guide, with npoints = 20 the results were observed to diverge at the second significant figure.

3. Additional Changes to the Code
=================================
* Some bugs in the last update to equilibrium.py have been patched, and a couple of functions have been rationalised.

* In this endeavour, changes have been made to the following functions: the three internalInductance functions, poloidalBeta2(), intersectsWall(), and effectiveElongation().

* effectiveElongation(), which calculates the elongation of the plasma using its volume, does not require inner and outer wall positions as input arguments anymore.
